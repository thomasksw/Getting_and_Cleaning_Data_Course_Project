Script name: run_analysis.R
Set directory to C:\user\documents\Data Science
This script does the following. 
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
   the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Data spec. of the columns of the data set created in step 5 - sortedDataAverage.txt
 Activity - label on type of activity measured: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 
 Subject - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
 TrainSet - A combined data of 561-feature vector of time and frequency domain variables
 body_acc_x/body_acc_y/body_acc_z refers to Triaxial acceleration on x, y, z axis  
 body_gyro_x/body_gyro_y/body_gyro_z - triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope 
 total_acc_x/total_acc_y/total_acc_z refers to estimated total acceleration on x, y, z axis

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating 
the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters 
and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, 
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, 
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
